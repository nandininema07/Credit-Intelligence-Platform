core requirements of real-time monitoring, explainability, and actionable insights, here is a detailed description of how the user interface (UI) should be designed, including the requested chatbot tab.

The UI should be clean, modern, and data-rich, designed for financial analysts, risk managers, and investors who need to make quick, informed decisions. It is not just a reporting tool but an interactive analytical platform.

Overall UI Design Principles:
Clarity and Simplicity: Despite the complexity of the underlying data, the UI must be intuitive. Key information should be available at a glance, with options to drill down for more detail.

Data Visualization: Use interactive charts, graphs, and color-coding (e.g., green for positive, red for negative) to make complex data easy to interpret.

Real-time Focus: The UI should feel alive, with data updating in near real-time to reflect the latest market information.

Explainability First: Every piece of data, especially the credit score, should be accompanied by clear explanations. The user should never have to guess why a number has changed.

UI Component Breakdown:
The UI would be structured around a few key tabs, allowing for a logical flow of analysis.

1. Main Dashboard / Overview Tab
This is the landing page, providing a high-level, "mission control" view of the credit landscape.

Key Components:

Market Pulse: A dynamic chart at the top of the page showing the overall credit risk trend across a selected market or portfolio.

Top Movers: Two lists side-by-side: "Top Risers" and "Top Fallers," showing the companies with the most significant positive and negative credit score changes in the last 24 hours. Each entry would show the company name, its current score, and the percentage change.

Watchlist: A customizable module where users can pin companies they are monitoring closely. This would display a mini-chart of each company's recent score trend.

Alerts Feed: A real-time feed of the latest critical alerts (e.g., "Company XYZ score dropped 15% due to supply chain news").

Search Bar: A prominent, intelligent search bar that allows users to quickly find any company.

2. Company Deep Dive Tab
When a user clicks on a company from anywhere in the dashboard, they are taken to this detailed view. This is where the core "explainability" requirement is met.

Key Components:

Header: Displays the company name, its current real-time credit score in a large, bold font, and the daily trend (e.g., "+2.5% 📈").

Main Score Chart: An interactive historical chart showing the credit score over time. Users can select different timeframes (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc.). Key events (e.g., major news releases, earnings reports) would be marked on the chart.

The "Why" Module (Explainable AI): This is the most critical part of the UI. It would be broken down into sub-sections:

SHAP Force Plot: A clear, visual force plot generated by SHAP. It would show the positive and negative drivers of the current score. For example, "Positive driver: Strong earnings report (+5 points)" and "Negative driver: Negative sentiment from news articles (-8 points)." Features are written in plain English, not technical jargon.

Key Factors Breakdown: A simple, easy-to-read table listing the top 3-5 factors that influenced the latest score change, with their respective impact.

Recent Events Feed: A feed of the specific news articles, social media posts, and financial filings that were ingested by the model and influenced the score. Each item would have its sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) clearly marked.

3. Chatbot Tab (Your Requested Feature)
This tab provides a revolutionary way to interact with the data, making analysis conversational and intuitive. It directly addresses the need for accessible explainability.

Layout:

A clean, simple chat interface with a text input box at the bottom.

The main chat window would display the conversation history.

A sidebar with "Suggested Questions" to help users get started (e.g., "Why did Company X's score change today?", "Compare the credit risk of Company A and Company B.").

Functionality:

Natural Language Queries: Users can ask questions in plain English. The chatbot, powered by a large language model, understands the user's intent and queries the backend for the relevant data and explanations.

Interactive Analysis: The user can have a conversation with the platform.

User: "What caused the drop in ABC Corp's score this morning?"

Chatbot: "ABC Corp's score dropped by 12 points this morning. The primary driver was a news report about a factory shutdown, which contributed -15 points to the score. Would you like to see the article?"

On-Demand Reports: Users can ask the chatbot to generate quick summaries or comparisons.

User: "Give me a summary of the key risks for XYZ Inc."

Chatbot: "The key risks for XYZ Inc. are: 1) High debt-to-equity ratio, 2) Negative sentiment from recent social media discussions regarding product safety, and 3) Exposure to volatile raw material prices. You can find more details in the 'Deep Dive' tab."

Alert Clarification: Users can ask for more context on alerts they receive.

User: "Tell me more about the alert I got for DEF Ltd."

Chatbot: "DEF Ltd. had a positive score spike of 8% due to a new patent approval that was reported in several tech journals. This is seen as a strong positive indicator for future revenue."

4. Alerts Configuration Tab
This allows users to customize the proactive notifications, fulfilling the "timeliness" and "actionable" aspects of the problem statement.

Key Components:

Alert Creation: An intuitive interface for setting up custom alerts. Users can define triggers based on:

Specific companies or watchlists.

The magnitude of a score change (e.g., "alert me if the score changes by more than 5% in an hour").

Keywords in news or social media (e.g., "alert me if 'fraud' is mentioned in relation to any company on my watchlist").

Delivery Method: Users can choose how they want to be notified:

In-platform notification.

Email.

Automated phone call for the most critical, user-defined alerts.

Alert History: A log of all past alerts for review.

IMPORTANT
The UI should have a sidebar functionality
UI should be professional and exactly aligned to the requirements
On clicking any company on the dashboard, the respective Company Deep Dive Tab should open as a modal popup
Other than that, there should also be a separate Company Deep Dive Tab, with dropdown present to select any company and view the Analysis
Use your complete creativity and intelligence to make this project. The project has to be used in real world, hence the frontend should clearly convey the professionalism and ease of use. Use all your capabilities into making this project with extreme detail orientation and real-world feasibility



Your code must contain variety

There must be all the possible companies that can be analysed and not hardcoded

Also, the sources must be varied

Recall that in the ps, they expect to work with both structured and unstructured data from all sources, and since we are considering multilingual, we should be able to scrape all the financial data in all languages across the internet (including unofficial news, financial announcements of companies, social media etc) and then work with it to produce results
